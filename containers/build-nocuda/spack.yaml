# Simple generic spack environment specification for code needed to run 
# CajitaFluids on non-CUDA systems. In general we want to let spack figure 
# out the right version and options for hypre and MPI so we don't specify 
# them here. On particular systems, you may want to specify them directly.
spack:
  specs:
  - hdf5+mpi
  - silo@4.11 # Speficy a specific version because some of the bsd licensed versions don't build
  - hypre-cmake +mpi
  - kokkos std=17
  - cabana +hypre +mpi
